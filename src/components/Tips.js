            TIPS ON HOW TO PLAY SA POWERBALL GAME
          </h2>
          
          <p>
            Learn how to play SA PowerBall with the step-by-step guide below. You can take part online, in stores or via certain other services, 
            such as through the FNB website and mobile app. Draws are held every Tuesday and Friday at 20:58 and here's what you need to do to enter. 
            Choose five main numbers from 1 to 50, plus a PowerBall from 1 to 20. Your PowerBall can even be the same as one of your main numbers 
            because it is selected from a different set. You just need to mark your choices on your betslip if you play in-store. Online, simply select 
            the numbers you want to play. If you'd rather have random numbers, choose the Quick Pick option. If you wish to play more than one set of numbers, 
            move on to the next board on your betslip and choose another five main numbers and a PowerBall. You can choose your own numbers or select a 
            Quick Pick on each individual board. You can play as many boards as you want and spend up to a maximum of R2,000 per ticket. It costs R5 for 
            each set of PowerBall numbers. You can enter your numbers into just the next draw or take advantage of the Multi-Draw option to submit your 
            entries for up to 10 games in advance. It's a quick way to enter more than one draw ahead of time, but you just need to make sure you keep 
            hold of your ticket, as a single one will be issued to cover all the draws. If you play online, your numbers will be stored in your account. 
            Don't forget to add PowerBall Plus to your ticket if you want to give yourself more chances to win. All you need to do is select the PowerBall 
            Plus option on your betslip or online. For an additional fee of R2.50 per play, the selections you make for PowerBall will be entered into 
            the supplementary PowerBall Plus draw. This includes all additional sets of numbers and Multi-Draw purchases. Take a moment to check over your 
            betslip or online selections, then it's time to pay for your entries. If you're in a store, take your betslip to the teller to purchase your ticket. 
            If you're online, you'll need to make sure you have the funds in your player account to pay. The cut-off time for playing PowerBall is 20:30 on 
            draw days, leaving you just half an hour to wait to find out if you are a winner.
